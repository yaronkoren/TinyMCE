== About ==

TinyMCE is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for using the
open source TinyMCE text editor to edit page contents.

For more information on the TinyMCE extension, see its homepage at
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TinyMCE

== Credits ==

The TinyMCE extension was created by Duncan Crane and Yaron Koren.
It uses a significant amount of code from the VisualEditor
extension by Hallo Welt!, which is part of the BlueSpice MediaWiki
package. (Not to be confused with the better-known VisualEditor
extension developed by the Wikimedia Foundation.)

The majority of the code, though, consists of the TinyMCE editor
itself, which was mostly developed by the Ephox corporation.
